Backbone RequireJS example
==========================
A short example to illustrate the use of backbone and requireJs together.

The intention is to show how requireJs can be used to organise our code into small well defined modules. 
Backbone is used to organise the code within these modules and to provide communication between them via an event based
communication architecture.

The completed program is available on the master branch (this one!)

The tutorial moves through the branches in this order

- [start:](https://github.com/cormac/backbone-require-tutorial/tree/start)

  Search input view created
- dispatcher: 
  Global Event dispatcher created
- router: 
  Router added to the application
